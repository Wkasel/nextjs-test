# Overall

Great job! I'm impressed with the overall progress you've made in transitioning to not only react, but picking up Next along the way. I made a few initial edits to the base repo, and have a minor refactor I am suggesting. I will explain it in more detail here.

- I made a note about the HOC pattern vs. hooks. see [save_diana/src/pages/index.js](save_diana/src/pages/index.js)
- Rearranged folder structure
- Added a theme provider
- Added recommended implenentation of Material UI SSR fixes
- Removed unused packages from package.json
- Added \_app.js & \_document.js
- Added Theme Folder
- Made comment in `pages/index.js` about use of withStyles vs makeStyles.
